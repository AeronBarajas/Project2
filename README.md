## Project Description

This project will be a recreation of the news/ blog-space IGN. I will be using my own API that I will use to create the articles that reflect the real thing on the real website.

## API

Here is a sample code snippet from my api.

```
{
              "nodeType": "paragraph",
              "content": [
                {
                  "nodeType": "text",
                  "value": "The RX 6600 XT includes 8GB of GDDR6 memory with a memory speed of 16Gbps, 32 compute units, a 2359MHz game clock, and a 165 thermal design power, meaning you can use a 500W power supply if you decide to build a PC around the RX 6600 XT.",
                  "marks": [],
                  "data": {}
                }
              ],
              "data": {}
            }
```

- Header with a nav link back to the homepage
- Featured Article Cards
- List of articles
- Render data from the API to popluate the page with blog post
- Allow user to click on a post to open on a new page

#### PostMVP EXAMPLE

- Add commment section

## Components

##### Writing out your components and its descriptions isn't a required part of the proposal but can be helpful.

Based on the initial logic defined in the previous sections try and breakdown the logic further into stateless/stateful components.

| Component |                          Description                          |
| --------- | :-----------------------------------------------------------: |


Time frames are also vital in the development cycle. You have limited time to code all phases of the app. Your estimates can then be used to evaluate app possibilities based on the time needed and the actual time before the app must be submitted. It's always best to pad the time by a few hours to account for the unknown, adding an additional hour or two to each component to play it safe. Also, put a gif at the top of your Readme before you pitch, and you'll get a panda prize.

| Component        | Priority | Estimated Time | Time Invetsted | Actual Time |
| ---------------- | :------: | :------------: | :------------: | :---------: |
| Design Structure |    H     |      4hrs      |     hrs        |   hrs       |
| App              |    H     |      3hrs      |     hrs        |   hrs       |
| Header           |    H     |      2hrs      |     hrs        |   hrs       |
| Featured Cards   |    H     |      2hrs      |     hrs        |   hrs       |
| Article List     |    H     |      3hrs      |     hrs        |   hrs       |
| Individual Pages |    H     |      3hrs      |     hrs        |   hrs       |
| API stuff        |    H     |      3hrs      |     hrs        |   hrs       |
| Styling          |    H     |      3hrs      |     hrs        |   hrs       |
| Debugging        |    H     |      3hrs      |     hrs        |   hrs       |
| Total            |    H     |      26rs      |     hrs        |   hrs       |
